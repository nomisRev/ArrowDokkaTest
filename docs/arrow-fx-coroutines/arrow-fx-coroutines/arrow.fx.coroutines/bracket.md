Describes a task with safe resource acquisition and release in the face of errors and interruption. It would be the equivalent of an async capable try/catch/finally statements in mainstream imperative languages for resource acquisition and release.

## Parameters

common

| | |
|---|---|
| acquire | is the action to acquire the resource. |
| use | is the action to consume the resource and produce a result. Once the resulting suspend program terminates, either successfully, error or disposed, the [release](bracket.md) function will run to clean up the resources. |
| release | is the action that's supposed to release the allocated resource after use is done, irregardless of its exit condition.<br>import arrow.fx.coroutines.*<br>class File(url: String) {<br>  fun open(): File = this<br>  fun close(): Unit {}<br>  override fun toString(): String = "This file contains some interesting content!"<br>}<br>suspend fun openFile(uri: String): File = File(uri).open()<br>suspend fun closeFile(file: File): Unit = file.close()<br>suspend fun fileToString(file: File): String = file.toString()<br>suspend fun main(): Unit {<br>  //sampleStart<br>  val res = bracket(<br>    acquire = { openFile("data.json") },<br>    use = { file -&gt; fileToString(file) },<br>    release = { file: File -&gt; closeFile(file) }<br>  )<br>  //sampleEnd<br>  println(res)<br>}<!--- KNIT example-bracket-01.kt --> |
